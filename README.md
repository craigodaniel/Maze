Maze Generator and Solver (CLI/C#)

Personal project to play around with maze generation and solver/pathing algorithms. Includes "Fight" mode where two or more solvers start at opposite ends of the maze and die if they encounter the path of the other solver. Last one standing wins.

Includes easter egg music using Console.Beep() because the "Rule of Cool" always applies!
